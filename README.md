# To-Do List
This Flask RESTful-API is utilised for the very simple yet essential requirements to manage our tasks in an efficient manner.  

## Features:
These are the simple features the API provides for user convenience:  
1. __User Sign-In and Login__ : This Flask-RESTful API ensures user security and privacy. Upon registering, a confirmation email will be sent to your email address. Upon clicking the link, your credentials will be registered and you can use the app.  
2.__Secure features__: All endpoints require a JWT token, ensuring the API can not be accesed unless you have logged in and subsequently, logged out.  
3.__List of Users by ID__: A user may view the details of another user by ID. Passwords however, are not displayed.  
4.__Refresh tokens__: Certain features such as deleting tasks are locked and require you to refresh your token to access.  
5.__Creating tasks__: Tasks can be created with fields: Name, Category and Status.  
6.__Editing and Deleting tasks__: Tasks can be changed from pending to completed or non-important to important based on Name of Task.  
7.__Displaying tasks__: Individual tasks can be displayed based on name, as well as comprehensive list of tasks with two seperate endpoints.
